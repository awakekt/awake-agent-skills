# Vulkan Backend Engineering in Awake

Awake's Vulkan backend (`:awake:backend:vulkan`, `:awake:backend:vulkan:bindings`, and `:awake:backend:vulkan:bindings:android-native`) provides direct, high-performance hardware rendering without large engine runtime overhead.

Read [docs/architecture.md](../../docs/architecture.md), [docs/mvp-plan.md](../../docs/mvp-plan.md), and [skills/awake-render-pipeline/SKILL.md](../awake-render-pipeline/SKILL.md) first.

## Hardware only

This backend knows pipelines, buffers, textures, samplers and command recording. It must never
know what a skybox or a shadow *is* -- that is content, and content lives in the shared layer or
`samples/<game>/`. `verifyBackendLayering` enforces this on `check` and carries a shrinking
tracked-debt ledger of the files that still violate it. Before adding a content-shaped class here,
read `docs/reference/render-extensibility.md`.

## 1. Resource Lifetime Symmetry

Every Vulkan creation path must have an explicit, symmetrical destruction path:
- `VkDevice` / `VkInstance` / `VkSwapchainKHR` destruction ordering must match standard Vulkan spec rules.
- Texture and buffer objects must track their memory allocations (`VkDeviceMemory` / VMA allocator) and destroy them symmetrically when unbind/dispose occurs.
- Never rely on JVM finalizers or GC to release GPU handles.

## 2. JNI Bindings & Generated Code Contract

- `awake:backend:vulkan:bindings` contains ~126 generated files (`models/`, `enums/`) and 6 hand-authored root files (`Vulkan.kt`, `Common.kt`, `Annotations.kt`, `Flags.kt`, `VulkanSurface.kt`, `Version.kt`).
- **Rule**: Never hand-edit files in `models/` or `enums/` or the C++ JNI accessors. Always run the code generator in `:awake:backend:vulkan:generator`.
- Check [`awake/backend/vulkan/README.md`](../../awake/backend/vulkan/README.md) before modifying binding layers.

## 3. Swapchain & Surface Resize Behavior

- Window resize triggers `VulkanSwapchain` recreation.
- Ensure the backing surface is properly queried for `minImageCount`, `currentExtent`, and supported format/color space before recreating the swapchain.
- Avoid the "backing surface never resized" failure mode by synchronizing surface dimensions with the native window size on each frame boundary.
- For swapchain fundamentals, consult [vulkan-tutorial.com](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/).

## 4. UI Shader Artifacts

UI shader source is owned by ASL in `:awake:asset:shader-pack`. Do not hand-edit Vulkan GLSL or
SPIR-V for a UI shader. Change the matching ASL definition, run
`./gradlew :awake:asset:shader-pack:generateAslShaders`, and verify the generated SPIR-V with
`./gradlew :awake:backend:vulkan:verifyShaderBinaries` plus a headless pixel test. ASL emits
WGSL; naga is the sole WGSL-to-SPIR-V translation step, so Vulkan-specific shader math is an
explicit exception that must be documented at the definition site.

## 5. Verification & Regression Gate

- **Android Vulkan is the primary regression gate**: Android device testing catches alignment, memory qualification, and synchronization bugs that desktop drivers may silently tolerate.
- **Headless Pixel Baselines**: When touching shader pipelines or draw submissions, run headless pixel-baseline tests (`PixelBaseline.kt`) to verify frame output determinism.
- **Frame-Timing Harness**: When modifying command buffer recording or state transitions, verify frame timing metrics using `TimingBaseline` in `awake:ui:testing`.
