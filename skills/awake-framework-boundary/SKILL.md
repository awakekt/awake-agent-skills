# Awake Framework Boundary

Read [framework-game-boundary.md](../../docs/reference/framework-game-boundary.md) before
deciding where a capability belongs.

Classify the proposal as **Awake capability**, **consumer/game code**, or **defer**.

1. A future MMORPG is one consumer, not justification for a new Awake module.
2. Prefer consumer-side composition. Promote only after two credible consumers demonstrate the
   same stable need, or a concrete public-API limitation makes that impossible.
3. Keep accounts, combat, quests, inventories, economy, zones, shards, protocol messages,
   databases, authentication, and live operations in the consuming game.
4. A promoted capability exposes the smallest backend-neutral contract and must not make a
   network library, database, renderer, or UI stack mandatory for ECS/core runtime modules.
5. Record exceptions with consumers, missing API, contract owner, excluded policy, dependency
   direction, and validation plan.
6. Keep water, biomes, vegetation, prop placement, procedural generation, and game assets in a
   consumer/private pack. Awake may supply neutral terrain data and extension seams, never the
   authored world policy.

Use `awake-architecture-auditor` for the decision. Use implementation skills only after it.
