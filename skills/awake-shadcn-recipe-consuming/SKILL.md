# Consuming Awake Shadcn Recipes

Use this skill at call sites: games, samples, tools, and feature UI that consume Awake's
in-repository `:awake:ui:designsystem` module on the retained Compose UI runtime. For implementation inside the design system,
use `awake-shadcn-recipe-authoring` instead; for choosing the ownership layer of a new behavior, use
`awake-ui-authoring`.

When a component is being compared with official shadcn, also use
[`awake-shadcn-parity-workflow`](../awake-shadcn-parity-workflow/SKILL.md). A passing isolated
recipe fixture does not prove the real showcase/catalog route.

**The rule in one line, checked against real Compose module boundaries:** render visible UI
only through `shadcn*` recipes; `:awake:compose:foundation` layout/state (`Column`, `Row`, `Box`,
`Modifier`, `Arrangement`, and state helpers) stays fine to import for structure; `:awake:compose:ui` is never
imported by consumer code. `Column`/`Row`/`Box`/`Arrangement` live in Compose's
`compose-foundation` artifact — the same module as unstyled interaction behavior — not split
into their own module, and not owned by Material.

That settles the consumer rule. Foundation owns the neutral layout and control behavior used by
the design system, while `:awake:compose:ui` owns retained runtime mechanics. Full rationale,
including why this matters for the
"no new API unless Compose has it" rule: `docs/reference/ui-ownership.md`'s
"`ui-headless` is not `compose-foundation`" section.

## Start with the named design-system theme

Install a named design-system theme at the application root. Do not rely on Core's neutral
fallback theme in a sample or game.

```kotlin
uiScope.shadcnTheme(theme = ShadcnDefaultTheme) {
    shadcnButton(id = "save") { text("Save") }
}
```

Use `shadcnThemeValues(...)` when a complete immutable `ShadcnThemeValues` value is required
before a `UiScope` exists, such as application state or a host configuration. It implements
`UiThemeValues` for Core compatibility, but it is not the scoped provider:

```kotlin
val appTheme = shadcnThemeValues(dark = isDark)
```

Pass that complete [ShadcnThemeValues] value at the same scoped boundary when the product needs
custom Shadcn metrics. It never changes one component ad hoc:

```kotlin
uiScope.shadcnTheme(
    theme = ShadcnThemeValues(
        core = appTheme,
        metrics = ShadcnTheme.metrics,
    ),
) {
    shadcnButton(id = "save", label = "Save")
}
```

## Consume recipes; do not restyle Headless in app code

Use `shadcnButton`, `shadcnSurface`, `shadcnInput`, and other `shadcn*` recipes for visible UI.
Choose their named variant and size. An app or sample must not build its own `Style { ... }`
for a component or call a Headless widget merely to establish a custom look. If the needed
variant does not exist, add it in `ui-designsystem` with the official shadcn reference and
parity coverage.

Shadcn recipes do not expose a public `Style` override. Express local intent with their named
parameters (`variant`, `size`, `tone`, `emphasis`); put a product-wide visual change in a complete
`ShadcnThemeValues` value.

Headless remains appropriate for generic structure and behavior when a design-system recipe
already supplies the visible component. Never make an application theme provider or a local
visual-token registry to compensate for a missing recipe.

## Keep imports and dependencies one-way

Depend on `ui-designsystem` to access named themes and recipes. It brings the required Headless
behavior boundary with it. Application code may use public Headless layout/interaction APIs when
needed, but should not import Core primitives or style its own component surfaces.

## Before finishing

- Use a named design-system theme at the app or sample root.
- Use `UiScope.shadcnTheme(...)` for scoped provision and `shadcnThemeValues(...)` to create an
  immutable complete theme value.
- Use named `shadcn*` variants instead of app-authored component `Style` blocks.
- Use `ShadcnThemeValues` at the root for Shadcn metric customization, never as a
  per-component visual escape hatch.
- Keep behavior gaps in `ui-headless`; keep new look/variants in `ui-designsystem`.
- Compile the affected sample or game target and run its focused UI tests.

Read [UI ownership](../../docs/reference/ui-ownership.md) for the canonical module boundaries.
